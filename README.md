Car Rental Management system is a system to rent a car by the customer and the rate of the payment will be on an hourly basis. This system will be helpful for both the customer and the administrator. This is because this system works in an automated way where customers can register themselves, log in and book a car by their own preference by using the information of the car that will be added by the administrator and the payment will be shown for the booking at the end of the system.
